# Notion for Linux

This is a meta repo that contains scripts/stuff needed to build Notion for Linux

## Alternatives

If you're on Arch Linux, there is a package in the AUR called `notion-app`.

## How?

The electron sources are pulled out of the macOS dmg and then ran with a Linux version of Electron, yeah, it's that easy.

## Customizing

Modify `config.sh` before running `build.sh` or `makepkg -si`

```bash
ELECTRON_VERSION=x.x.x electron version to use
NOTION_VERSION=x.x.x notion dmg to download
```

## Installing

Ensure you have the dependencies installed:

 * 7zip (7zip on ubuntu)
 * dmg2img

Run `sudo ./build.sh [--no-compress]`

## Uninstalling

 - Run `sudo ./uninstall.sh`

Or manually:

 - Delete the application `rm -rf /opt/notion`
 - Delete desktop entry `rm -r ~/.local/share/applications/Notion.desktop`
 - Delete `rm /usr/bin/notion`
